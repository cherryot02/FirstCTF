## Catch The Flag or CTF
I only found about "CTFs" from browsing through Youtube on videos on how to build skills if I wanted a career in cybersecurity. CTF challenges were one of the many suggestions. \
CTFs are basically a gamified and digitalized type of catching a "flag". Kumbaga, tagu-taguan/hide-and-seek, the seeker is the user/you/me, and the flag is hiding in whatever code, program, or software is inside in. \
The whole goal is to be able to catch it within a certain amount of time. \
