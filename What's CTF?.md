## Catch The Flag or CTF
I only found about "CTFs" from browsing through Youtube videos on how to build skills if I wanted a career in cybersecurity. CTF challenges were one of the many suggestions. \
CTFs are basically a gamified and digitalized type of catching a "flag". Kumbaga, tagu-taguan/hide-and-seek, the seeker is the user/you/me, and the flag is hiding in whatever code, program, or software it is inside in. \
The whole goal is to be able to catch it within a certain amount of time.\

Most CTFs are time-based and winners are whovever finshed all the challenges first, or "paunahan". \
There's a rank system of some sort and there many organizations out there that host these type of competition.\

## Virgina Cyber Range CTF
This VA Cyber Range is the one provided by our college. They have various VMs and target systems for us test our skills and labs. \
The CTF I will be doing is what they called "Cloud CTF". \

## Cloud CTF
I will insert images if I can.
Cloud CTF is basically the CTF challenge VA Cyber Range has, I believe they change some of these time to time but I have seen similar challenges from prior users so take what I said with a grain of salt.\

## END 
These are mostly opnionated and again, unprofessionally done. \
There may be other ways of determining the flags but again, I just did what I could do.\
