# FirstCTF
This is a short documentation on what did for my first time participating in a class Cloud Catch The Flag game via Virginia Cyber Range.
The CTF was divided into 6 categories:
<ul>
  <li>Cryptography</li>
  <li>Networking</li>
  <li>Ready Player...</li>
  <li>Reconnaissance</li>
  <li>Reverse Engineering</li>
  <li>Web</li>
</ul>

Each categories has 5-6 challenges that's worth some points depending on the difficulty. </br>  
My class only required 300 pts, but in total, the CTF is 700 pts. So While there were 6 categories, I only did some of Cryptography, Networking and Reverse Engineering.


Disclaimer: This is not a how-to but more so how I did it. :v:
